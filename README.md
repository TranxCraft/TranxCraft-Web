## Contributing ##


If you wish to contribute to the project you must only develop in the **development** branch (this will be created when the first alpha is released), and we also please ask that you follow our below stated coding style.

All must be written following the Stroustrup coding style. An example of this can be seen below:

 ```php
 if ($cond == true) {
   //...
 }
 else {
   //...
 }

 ```

Other guidelines we ask that you follow are:

- Booleans must be written in lower-case
- Class names must be declared using `StudlyCaps`
- Method names must be declared using `camelCase`
- Class constants must be declared in `CAPS` with underscores for separation
- The closing PHP tag `?>` must be omitted
- Only `<?php` and `<?=` are acceptable
